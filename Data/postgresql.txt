CREATE TABLE comments
(ID varchar, SUBREDDIT varchar, THREAD varchar, THREAD_ID varchar, USERNAME varchar, COMMENT varchar, SCEPTICISM double precision, LOVE double precision, NEGATIVITY double precision, FEAR double precision, DESIRE double precision,
POSITIVITY double precision, HATE double precision, VIOLENCE double precision);

COPY comments FROM './csv_with_sentiment.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV;

Remember to strip csv_with_sentiment.csv so it doesn't have a header, postres doesn't understand that per default. Also, let's change name to "comments_with_sentiment.csv" instead of csv redundance.

To get the weighted score of love from pics.
SELECT SUM(love)/(SELECT COUNT(comment) as numcomments FROM comments WHERE subreddit='pics') as cnt FROM comments WHERE subreddit='pics';

Complete query:
SELECT SUM(love)/COUNT(comment) as love, SUM(fear)/COUNT(comment) as fear, SUM(scepticism)/COUNT(comment) as scepticism, SUM(negativity)/COUNT(comment) as negativity,
SUM(desire)/COUNT(comment) as desire, SUM(hate)/COUNT(comment) as hate, SUM(violence)/COUNT(comment) as violence, SUM(positivity)/COUNT(comment) as positivity 
FROM comments WHERE subreddit='pics;



ISSUES!!!
Different default setups for optimization out of the box, this will impact.
Different query formulation, i.e. how optimized are our queries? Are we writing smart cypher and stupid SQL?
