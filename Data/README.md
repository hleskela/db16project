1, AskReddit, "Right now at this very moment, as you read this question, what is your #1 desire?", I_have_fingers, "I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes, I'm not a native English speaker. please do not become a red piller. just know this: unless you are living in a war, in a third world country or during a zombie apocalypse, a woman who needs to be 'protected', like she's a three years old, is usually just a needy, insecure (and somewhat lazy) person looking for validation and appreciation, not for an emotional attachment. there are lots of women capable of looking after themselves and that may want to be with you, without toying with your feelings. stop wasting your time, work on yourself more than on your game and go get them."
2, BlackPeopleTwitter, "Was we?", BEGA500, "That comment is gonna make her have some awkward, insecure conversations in the future. That shit is life changing."
3, worldnews, "Russia offers water bombers and specialists to help fight Fort McMurray forest fires", Instinct121, "This is one of the few times we could see newspaper headlines like: RUSSIA BOMBS CANADA. MASSIVE FIRES BURN COUNTRYSIDE. CANADA THANKS RUSSIA FOR ITS EFFORT."
4, Futurology, "Lilium the world's first electric vertical take-off and landing jet", opelmanz, "the video found in this link is unbelievably lame."
